### Using props

You can make this block's content dynamic by using props.

1. Wrap the content of this block in a named export. Example:

```jsx title=content/blocks/NAME-OF-BLOCK.mdx
export const NameOfBlock = ({heading}) => (
  // Add the source code here.
)
```

2. Then use props in the block content by replacing the static text with props. Example: `<h1 variant="heading.h1">{heading}</h1>`.
3. Include it on your page using the following code:

```md
<Block src="NAME-OF-BLOCK" heading="A Heading" />
```

You can pass as many props as you need.
