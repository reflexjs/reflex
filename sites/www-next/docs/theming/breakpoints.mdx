To configure the default breakpoints used in responsive array values, add a `breakpoints` array to your theme.

Each breakpoint should be a string with a CSS length unit included.

```js title=theme.js
module.exports = {
  breakpoints: ["640px", "768px", "1024px", "1280px"],
}
```

These values will be used to generate mobile-first (i.e. min-width) media queries, which can then be used to apply [responsive styles](/docs/theming/responsive-styles).
